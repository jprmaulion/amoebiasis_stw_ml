# Forecasting amoebiasis cases in Southern Taiwan using machine learning methods and transfer entropy-based feature engineering
I constructed an XGB-based model to forecast weekly amoebiasis cases in Southern Taiwan; used lagged values of imported cases and current cases as model features. I primarily used `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `scikit-optimize`, `pyinform` for ML modeling and feature engineering.
